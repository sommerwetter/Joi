# Joi
Supreme Bot with an UI; based of my CopBot project

**--OUTDATED FOR THE MOMENT--**

Windows and MacOS

Chrome Driver version 96

-- UPDATES --

- Update v.0.0.21: Added a save and load function, to make it more convenient in adding your credentials. Please refer to "HOW TO USE" down below for further instructions.

- Update v.0.0.2: Added chrome auto log in support; for this you will need to enter your PC's Username (further explained by clicking the '?' button next to it). This is supposed to reduce bot detection. This is necessary for the bot to work from now on. 

- Selenium bypass got patched. So you have to manually enter captcha; If captcha is wrong, it is recommended to close the window and click start again.

- checkout speed reduced from 14.8s to 10s

- Update v.0.0.11: Added delay function; added new "automated software" bypass; tested and finished with 14800ms (14.8s) fastest speed checkout (total). Working on reducing speed checkout time without reducing success rate.

- Update v.0.0.1 New UI

Chromedriver modified to bypass Selenium detection.
